### Introduction

The title says it all: A rookie from the Class of 23 wants to enter the gaming industry. Without a demo and experience, it's tough to break in. So, I've just started working on creating some small games. The plan is to get them to a semi-finished state first, and if there's an opportunity in the future, I'll consider completing and releasing them. Of course, the primary goal right now is to find a job.



On GitHub, I'll only be uploading the exported files and code for the game since I'm using free assets provided by others and a small portion that I've created myself, which I won't be sharing. If I have the time, I'll create a class diagram for easier reference.



### Engine Choice

When I was halfway through making the game, Unity threw a curveball, and I started feeling unsure about Unity's reliability for the future. But the problem is, I've only learned Unity, and it's frustrating. My current plan is to continue using Unity for a few projects and, in the meantime, learn Godot and UE5.
